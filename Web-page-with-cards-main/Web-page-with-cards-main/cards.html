                    Front end development is a style of computer programming that focuses on the coding and creation of elements and features of a website that will then be seen by the user. It's about making sure the visual aspects of a website are functional. You can also think of front end as the “client side” of an application.

                    Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.
